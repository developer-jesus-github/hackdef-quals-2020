In this challenger you could buy the flag if you had the necessary money but as you can see you did not have the necessary money for almost anything.

Looking through the request headers i noticed that a cookie was being sent and seemed to contain a strange format, in this case being a base32 so I proceeded to decode it.

So I put in the amount of money I needed to buy the flag and that's how I got it.
